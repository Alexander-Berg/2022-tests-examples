* Kernel tests

** Test types
*** Test inside VM
    Simplest ways to test low level things is is to run tests  inside VM.
    This approach scale very well because typical test vm is small ,2core/4gb. 
    So we can run 12-28 vms on one HW host in parallel. Qemu support large list
    of virtual HW so we can simulate test  hw falures.
    It is reasonable to use ssh as communication channel because
    - Use same execution channel as HW nodes
    - Allow interactive debugging

*** Real HW test
    Run test on real hardware. This approach does not scale, but it is the only way to test actual hardware.
    We may have dedicated nodes for testing or api for hw allocation from YP.

** Tests list
*** xfstests, blktest [VM]
    Standard generic filesystem/blockdev regression test-suite.

**** yandex-speciffic tests [VM]

*** Stress tests [VM,HW]
    It would be nice to have collection of stress tests which takes ~1-2hr and test system
    under various load condidtions. Also it may be reasonable to collect regression tests for
    trivial scalability issues.

*** Data consystency tests [VM,HW]
    We have number of bugs with data consistency during power failure.

    - https://st.yandex-team.ru/RUNTIMECLOUD-3410
    We definitely want to have power off consistency tests similar https://st.yandex-team.ru/RUNTIMECLOUD-6558#5b0410e45b25cf001a874f5e

*** cgroups unit tests (khlebnikov) [VM]
